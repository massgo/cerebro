## Django-portion: 

Currently the Django portion of this project is in development and set to use SQLite. To set things up locally: 

1. Ensure packages in `requirements.txt` are installed
2. From the Django project root directory [cerebro](cerebro) run `python manage.py makemigrations; python manage.py migrate`
3. Create a superuser with `python manage.py createsuperuser` and follow prompts (login is required to view data) 
4. Populate your local SQLite database with fake data by running the `populate_fake_database.py` script
5. Start up a local dev. server with `python manage.py runserver`; the default site root is [http://127.0.0.1](http://127.0.0.1)
6. Navigate to [http://127.0.0.1/admin](http://127.0.0.1/admin) and login with your created superuser
7. Navigate to [http://127.0.0.1/members](http://127.0.0.1/members) to see a list of (fake) AGAMembers
